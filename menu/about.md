### About Ben

I am a Midwest-based iOS developer with a knack for solving business problems.

I am grateful for the chance to have studied iOS development with some of the best iOS instructors in the world at Lambda School.

Before transitioning into software development, I enjoyed a successful career as a financial analyst, portfolio manager, and business development consultant in the real estate, finance, and energy sectors.

When I'm not working or tinkering on side projects, I like to spend time with family, get outside, and generally stay active.
