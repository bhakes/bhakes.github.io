I like quotes. I sometimes write them down if I really like them. These are list of quotes I wrote down at some point, and thought we also good enough to repost here. Enjoy!

### Software/Technology
* "Don't worry about what anybody else is going to do. The best way to predict the future is to invent it." - Alan Kay
* "The first 90 percent of the code accounts for the first 90 percent of the development time. The remaining 10 percent of the code accounts for the other 90 percent of the development time. (The 90/90 Rule)" — Tom Cargill, Bell Labs

### Risk-taking and Skin-in-the-Game
* “The curse of modernity is that we are increasingly populated by a class of people who are better at explaining than understanding, or better at explaining than doing.”  ― Nassim Nicholas Taleb, Skin in the Game: Hidden Asymmetries in Daily Life
* “You do not want to win an argument. You want to win.”  ― Nassim Nicholas Taleb, Skin in the Game: Hidden Asymmetries in Daily Life
* “Those who talk should do and only those who do should talk.” ― Nassim Nicholas Taleb, Skin in the Game: The Hidden Asymmetries in Daily Life

### Modernity
* “To bankrupt a fool, give him information.” ― Nassim Nicholas Taleb, The Bed of Procrustes: Philosophical and Practical Aphorisms

### Learning and the lack thereof
* “We all are learning, modifying, or destroying ideas all the time. Rapid destruction of your ideas when the time is right is one of the most valuable qualities you can acquire. You must force yourself to consider arguments on the other side.” ― Charles T. Munger
* “What I learned on my own I still remember” - Nassim Nicholas Taleb, The Bed of Procrustes: Philosophical and Practical Aphorisms
* “They think that intelligence is about noticing things that are relevant (detecting patterns); in a complex world, intelligence consists in ignoring things that are irrelevant (avoiding false patterns).” ― Nassim Nicholas Taleb, The Bed of Procrustes: Philosophical and Practical Aphorisms

### Awareness
* "Society is the outward projection of all our own inward psychological states." - J. Krishnamurti
* “The beginning of freedom is the realization that you are not “the thinker.” The moment you start watching the thinker, a higher level of consciousness becomes activated. You then begin to realize that there is a vast realm of intelligence beyond thought, that thought is only a tiny aspect of that intelligence. You also realize that all the things that truly matter – beauty, love, creativity, joy, inner peace – arise from beyond the mind. You begin to awaken.” ― Eckhart Tolle, Practicing the Power of Now: Essential Teachings, Meditations, and Exercises from the Power of Now
* “Love is a state of Being. Your love is not outside; it is deep within you. You can never lose it, and it cannot leave you. It is not dependent on some other body, some external form.” ― Eckhart Tolle, Practicing the Power of Now: Essential Teachings, Meditations, and Exercises from the Power of Now
* “You can't stop the waves, but you can learn to surf.” - JKZ
