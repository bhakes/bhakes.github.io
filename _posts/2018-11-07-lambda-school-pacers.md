# Notes From Day 3 @Lambda School

Today will be my third day at Lambda school. I am enjoying things so far. I really like the interactive nature of the classes, especially compared to my classes @ ASU. I definitely do better when I’ve got people to ‘pace’ against. This is an interesting observation that I’ve not quite internalized until now. I think the idea of having someone to ‘pace’ against is an idea that I intuitively knew from sports in high school, and some brief experience with running in grade school. ‘Pacers’ help me a lot because they help me stay on the path, helping me stay focused. It would be nice to not have to need pacers, but it takes tremendous focus and clarity on your goals if you want to go without a pacer. Furthermore, if you don’t know exactly where you are headed, pacers can be really helpful, because they help you keep moving in some direction.

## You are the Average of Your 5 Closest Friends

This idea is closely linked with the idea that you are the average of the 5 people that you spend the most time with. If you choose to spend time with ‘pacers’, you ultimately will assimilate some of their behavior and skills, and they your behavior and skills.

There seems to be a delicate balance between running with pacers and trying to become your pacer. Ultimately, you are on your own path. But, your path and your race can sometimes be a very similar path to that of a pacer for a while.

Having a pacer is also just more fun. ‘Pacers’, who we often have a lot in common with, can quickly become close friends. Inside jokes are well-known.

## Developing Pacers and Playing Long-term Games

I’d like to develop more pacers. It’s also important to focus on those who want to play “long-term games”. I’ve already started to notice how I interact with people when I want to play long term games. My disposition, my willingness to understand and forgive is heightened. My honesty is heightened as well. I’m more likely to tell the person what I honestly believe. After all, if you’re playing a long game, the person is going to appreciate that you were honest at each turn, even if what you felt at each moment wasn’t always what the people wanted to hear. Ultimately, if they are not interested in playing long-term games with you, it doesn’t matter that you trick them with some nicety early on. At some point they will leave you. So why worry?

It think one of the most difficult things about switching careers, learning new skills is the lack of ‘pacers’. This is what Lambda School helps facilitate.
