Today will be my third day at Lambda school (day2 for software engineers :-) ). I am enjoying the cirriculum so far and really like the interactive nature of the classes, especially compared to my software engineering coursework at ASU. 

For today's post I want to talk about "Pacers".

I do better when I’ve got people to ‘pace’ against. I’ve not quite internalized this observation until now. But now, I realize that the idea of having someone to ‘pace’ against is an idea that I learned from sports in high school, as well as from a brief stint running track in grade school.

‘Pacers’ help a lot because they help you stay on the path. They help you stay focused. It would be nice to not have to need pacers, but it takes tremendous focus and clarity on your goals if you want to go without a pacer. Sometimes you fail to muster that focus. Furthermore, if you don’t know exactly where you are headed, pacers can be really helpful, because they help you keep moving in some direction.

## You are the Average of Your 5 Closest Friends

The idea of a 'pacer' is closely linked with the idea that "you are the average of the 5 people that you spend the most time with". If you choose to spend time with ‘pacers’, you will assimilate some of their behavior and skills, and they your behavior and skills.

There is delicate balance between running with pacers and trying to become your pacer. Ultimately, you are on your own path and running your own race. But, your path and your race can sometimes be a very similar path to that of a pacer, at least for a while.

Having a pacer is also just more fun. ‘Pacers’, who we often have a lot in common with, can quickly become close friends.

## Developing Pacers and Playing Long-term Games

I want to develop more pacers in tech. At the same time, I'm only interested in those who want to play “long-term games”. 

I’ve started to notice how I interact with people when I want to play long term games. My disposition, my willingness to understand and forgive is heightened. I’m more likely to tell the person what I honestly believe. After all, if you’re playing a long game, the person is going to appreciate that you were honest at each turn, even if what you felt at each moment wasn’t always what the people wanted to hear. 

Ultimately, if they are not interested in playing long-term games with you, it doesn’t matter that you "trick" them with some nicety early on. At some point they will leave you. So why worry?

It think one of the most difficult things about switching careers, learning new skills with the lack of ‘pacers’. This is what Lambda School helps facilitate.
