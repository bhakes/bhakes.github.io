This post represents a summary of an article on iOS12 from NSHipster. For every greater detail about iOS 12 changes, check out the [full article](https://nshipster.com/ios-12/).

### Release Notes and New Features with iOS 12

When every major iOS release comes out, Apple offers [iOS release notes](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/ios_release_notes/ios_12_release_notes) and [Foundation release notes](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/ios_release_notes/ios_12_release_notes/foundation_release_notes) for developers to quickly learn more about the new release, any deprecations, and any potential issues that come with the release. But Apple also loves to make a big deal about their new technologies. They do that at events like WWDC, and specifically at sessions like [Platform State of the Union](https://developer.apple.com/videos/play/wwdc2018/102/).

For iOS 12, the big headline technologies Apple highlighted at WWDC were: 
- Siri Shortcuts
- ARKit 2
- Core ML 2
- And the (apparently Bombshell) pre-announcement of an iOS / Mac bridge, codenamed “Marzipan”.

But there are many other, smaller changes, ones that are kinda fun to explore. Some smaller changes include:
- Prioritizing Network Traffic for Important Requests
- Reading NFC Tags in the Background
- Matching Contacts on Phone Number and Email Address
- Updating Location While Airborne
- Detecting Flat Device Orientation
- Auto-filling New Passwords and One-Time Codes in Text Fields
Let's take a look at a few of these smaller changes.

### Prioritizing Network Traffic for Important Requests
Apparent, back in 2015, Apple [partnered](https://newsroom.cisco.com/press-release-content?type=webcontent&articleId=1715414) with Cisco, whos routers handle about 50% of the network traffic on the internet. They partnered to come up with a "Quality-of-Service" or QoS designation for sending information in a URLRequest. URLRequest objects can now set networkServiceType to NSURLNetworkServiceTypeResponsiveData to prioritize time-sensitive requests:

```swift
import Foundation

let url = URL(string: "https://example.com/checkout")!
var request = URLRequest(url: url)
request.httpMethod = "POST"
request.networkServiceType = .responsiveData // Prioritize

URLSession.shared.dataTask(with: request) {
    (data, response, error) in
    // ...
}

```

Apple says to "use this feature judiciously, only when time is of the essence". One example they [provided](https://developer.apple.com/videos/play/wwdc2018/714/) is “the checkout page for a shopping app”. Maybe it could also be used for [Austen Cole](https://github.com/AustinBCole)'s [Birth Ride App](https://github.com/labs11-uberambulance/labs11-uberAmbulanceiOS).

### Detecting Flat Device Orientation
This one is pretty simple. Want to check if the device is flat? Just use this:
```swift
import UIKit
// iOS 12+
UIDevice.current.orientation.isFlat

```

### Reading NFC (near-field communication) Tags in the Background
At WWDC 2018 a new ndefMessagePayload property was added to NSUserActivity. Apple engineers wouldn't say what it was for. Then, Apple released the iPhone X and Xr, which support "reading NFC tags in the background". I don't really know exactly what this means, but apparently, with the latest hardware and software, one can:
> launch apps, start calls, and open URLs in response to scanning compatible NFC tags
> > *note this only works when the device is unlocked and not in Apple Pay/Camera/Airplane mode

With this update, Apple wants to make NFC super easy and ubiquitous, and avoid going down the path of scanning QR codes everywhere.

In order to set up NFC, there still is a lot of work related to entitlements, setting associated domains, and other configurations. [This](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/corenfc/building_an_nfc_tag_reader_app?changes=latest_minor) article and [this](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/corenfc/adding_support_for_background_tag_reading?changes=latest_minor) sample project seems to be helpful for getting started with NFC.
