In a recently published and widely read [article](https://a16z.com/2020/04/18/its-time-to-build/), [Marc Andreessen](https://twitter.com/pmarca) issued a sort of “call-to-arms”, for America to stop twiddling its thumbs and to start building real, impactful things. I LOVE the spirit in which this essay was written — I believe whole-heartedly that we need to focus on being a nation of builders. If you haven't read it already, I encourage you to before reading on.

Still, in the article, Marc offers a challenge to those that disagree with his diagnosis, and the actions that should be taken:

```
“Instead of attacking my ideas of what to build, conceive your own! What do you think we should build?” - Marc A.
```

So I have decided to write this critique, and to offer a solution.

## The Error in Marc’s Thinking

There is one specific error in the article:
```
Is the problem money? That seems hard to believe ...
```

Marc doesn’t believe money is the problem. After all, the events of the past weeks have shown that the US can (attempt to) mobilize trillions of dollars of resources when backed against a wall.

Unfortunately, this misses the point. The problem isn’t the _quantity_ of money. It’s the _quality_ and nature of our money. Specifically, its the fact that the US Dollar is _not only_ our national currency, but it is also the world’s global reserve currency. Why is that important? Well, let me take you back to the 18th century and the writings of a famous economic thinker named Richard Cantillon.

## Richard Cantillon - A Monetary Theorist Ahead of His Time

[Richard Cantillon](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Richard_Cantillon) was an 18th century Irish-French economist, banker, entrepreneur, and writer. One of his few surviving [works](https://mises.org/library/essay-economic-theory-0) is “[An Essay on Economic Theory](https://mises.org/library/essay-economic-theory-0)”, in which Cantillon lays out one of the first complete treaties on economics. It also happens to be one of the earliest essays on monetary theory.

In one particular chapter, Cantillon describes a phenomenon that he saw play out with the Spanish and the Portuguese during the previous two centuries (16th and 17th) that has incredible importance to today. 

Specifically, Cantillon describes how the Spanish, via the newfound gold mines in the new world, and the Portuguese, via new gold mines in Brazil, _impoverished themselves_ with the flood of new hard money coming from their mines. Ironically, by supplying lots of new hard money into their state, the mines hollowed out their  _artisan, creative class_ by driving up prices for this class (a.k.a., Marc's "builders") and then outsourcing their work. This was all done to the favor of a small rentier class of financiers that were closer to the source of the new money in the mines. The increase in prices eventually _drove out_ the artisan creative class, as goods could be produced cheaper elsewhere and imported (a.k.a., 'Made in China').

Below is Cantillon's summary of the phenomenon from `An Essay on Economic Theory`:

```
If the increase of hard money comes from gold and silver mines within the state, the owner of these mines, the entrepreneurs, the smelters, refiners, and all the other workers will increase their expenses in proportion to their profits. Their households will consume more meat, wine, or beer than before. — Part 2, Ch. 6, p. 170
…

All this increased expenditures on meat, wine, wool, etc., necessarily reduces the share of the other inhabitants in the state who do not participate at first in the wealth of the mines in question. — Part 2, Ch. 6, p. 171
…

If money continues to be extracted from the mines, the abundance of money will increase all prices to such a point that not only will the property owners raise their rents considerably when the leases expire and resume their old lifestyle, increasing their servants’ wages proportionally, but the artisans and workmen will increase the prices of the articles they produce so high that there will be a considerable gains in buying them from foreigners who make them much cheaper. This will naturally encourage several people to import products at lower prices from foreign factories, and this will gradually ruin the artisans and manufacturers of the state who will be unable to sustain themselves by working at such low rates because of the high cost of living. — Part 2, Ch. 6, p. 172

…

When the overabundance of money from the mines has diminished the number of inhabitants in a state, accustomed those who remain to excessive expenditures, raised the prices of farm products and the wages for labor to high levels, and ruined the manufactures of the state by the purchase of foreign products by property owners and mine workers, the money produced by the mines will necessarily go abroad to pay for the imports. This will gradually impoverish the state and make it, in a way, dependent on foreigners to whom it is obliged to send money every year as it is extracted from the mines. The great circulation of money, which was widespread in the beginning, ceases; poverty and misery follow and the exploitation of the mines appears to be only advantageous to those employed in them and to the foreigners who profit thereby. — Part 2, Ch. 6, p. 172-173

```
If this situation sounds all too familiar its because it's exactly what's been going on with the US Dollar over the past half a century.

## The United States’s Gold Mine — The US Dollar

Because the US Dollar is the global reserve currency, the U.S. Government, through the Federal Reserve, is in effectively in the same position as the Spanish and Portuguese of the 16th and 17th century -- it owns a gold mine.

As long as the Fed acts somewhat prudently (and doesn't print too many dollars all at once, destroying confidence in them), the U.S. can continue to “extract” dollars from this “gold mine” by printing new dollars or otherwise manipulating the money supply. Even in a time of unprecedent monetary stimuluous on the part of the Fed, the world economy seems eager to [sop up every dollar that is printed, any way it can](https://www.lynalden.com/global-dollar-short-squeeze/).

What happens to these dollars that get extracted in today's world? The process is similar to the one Cantillon described above in his example of a colony that discovers a gold mine.

First, the U.S., through its central bankers (who are the mine operators in this analogy), print money and manipulate interest rates in a way that increases the money supply. This is usually done is through coordinated effort with their “employees”, the bankers. The bankers, or commercial bankers, are the first ones to get the newly printed money, and are thus like the employees in the Spanish and Portuguese’s mines in Cantillon’s example. The commercial bankers then lend out some of the rest of the money to projects that they think will provide them with a positive return on their capital. Importantly, the bankers spend some of this money on goods and services. They spend it on dry cleaning, on nice steak dinners, and on home repairs to their second house in the Hamptons. All this spending generally raises prices for goods and labor.

Those with strong relationships and access to the commerical bankers are the next to get the money. These people and institutions tend to be corporations and corporate officers with existing banking relationships. When those corporate officers get access to the bank money, they go and spend money on other goods and services, which generally raises prices for goods and services in the economy even more.

The last people to get access to this new money are the artisans, the folks who haven't been cultivating relationships with bankers, but rather, have been building real things. They are the bakers, the blacksmiths, and the builders. Unfortunately for them, the general price level has already been elevate by the central bankers, the commercial bankers, and corporations with close ties to both. The effect is that their money is worth less. This whole process is know as the [Cantillon Effect](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Richard_Cantillon#Monetary_theory), and it is one of the most fundamental ideas for which to understand the operation of the modern U.S. economic structure.

Eventually, the only way for the bakers, and blacksmiths, and builders to survive is by raising their prices. But, unfortunately, _they can't raise their prices too much_, because eventually individuals in the state will start to buy foreign goods at much cheaper prices from builders and manufacturers that don't have to pay for the costs of living inflated price state.

This _dis-incentive_ for building within the state with the gold mine is the root problem. The access to the mine incentivizes the rent-seeking behavior which Marc (and I, and many others) so dearly loath. To quote Cantillon, "This will gradually impoverish the state and make it, in a way, dependent on foreigners to whom it is obliged to send money every year as it is extracted from the mines."

This is exactly what happens in the U.S. today. In exchange for the world using the US Dollar as the global reserve currency, we run a massive trading deficit. Instead of making good, we outsource them to places where making good is cheaper. The incentive to build great things in the U.S. has been eroded because its _so much easier to make lots of money_ being a middle-man to a large financial transaction. So instead of incentivizing building the next great civic infrastructure, or an army of automated robots, we incentivize people to be real estate brokers and investment bankers.

## Conceiving of a Different Plan: Walking Away from Global Reserve Currency

Marc didn't just want my criticisms in this response. He challenged us to come up with a better plan. So here's mine:

*The U.S. Government needs to preemptively give up the US Dollar's global reserve currency status.*

We have to let go of the curse of the gold mine (the USD), the same curse that befell the Spanish and the Portuguese in the 16th and 17th century. Nothing short of this will get us back to being builders.
