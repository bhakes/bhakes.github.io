In a recently published and widely read [article](https://a16z.com/2020/04/18/its-time-to-build/), [Marc Andreessen](https://twitter.com/pmarca) issued a sort of “call-to-arms”, for us to stop twiddling our thumbs and to start building real, impactful things. I LOVE the spirit in which this essay was written —  I believe whole-heartedly that we need to focus on being a nation of builders.

Still, in the article, Marc offers a challenge to those that disagree with his diagnosis, and the actions that should be taken.

“Instead of attacking my ideas of what to build, conceive your own! What do you think we should build?” - Marc A.

So I have decided to write this critic, and to offer a solution.

## The Error in Marc’s Thinking

There is one specific error in the article, and here it is:
```
Is the problem money? That seems hard to believe ...
```

Marc doesn’t believe money is the problem. After all, the events of the past weeks have shown that the US can (attempt to) mobilize trillions of dollars of resources when backed against a wall.

Unfortunately, this misses the point. The problem isn’t the _quantity_ of money. It’s the _quality_ and nature of our money. Specifically, its is the fact that the US Dollar is _not only_ our national currency, but it is also the world’s global reserve currency. Why is that important? Well, let me take you back to the 18th century and the writings of a famous economic thinker named Richard Cantillon.

## Richard Cantillon - A monetary theorist ahead of his time

[Richard Cantillon](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Richard_Cantillon) was an 18th century Irish-French economist, banker, entrepreneur, and writer. One of his few surviving [works](https://mises.org/library/essay-economic-theory-0) is “[An Essay on Economic Theory](https://mises.org/library/essay-economic-theory-0)”, in which Cantillon lays out one of the first complete treaties on economics. It also happens to be one of the earliest essay on monetary theory.

One particular chapter, Cantillon describes a phenomena that he saw play out with the Spanish and the Portuguese during the previous two centuries (15th and 16th) that has incredible importance to today. 

Specifically, he describes how the Spanish, via the gold mines in the new world, and the Portuguese, via gold mines in Brazil, _impoverished themselves_ with the flood of new hard money coming from their mines. Ironically, by supplying lots of new hard money, the mines drove up prices for the _artisan, creative class_ (a.k.a., the builders) in favor of a rentier class of financiers that were closer to the source of the new money. The increase in prices eventually _drove out_ the artisan creative class, as good could be produced cheaper elsewhere and import ('Made in China').

Below is Cantillon's summary of the phenomenon:

```
If the increase of hard money comes from gold and silver mines within the state, the owner of these mines, the entrepreneurs, the smelters, refiners, and all the other workers will increase their expenses in proportion to their profits. Their households will consume more meat, wine, or beer than before. — Part 2, Ch. 6, p. 170
…

All this increased expenditures on meat, wine, wool, etc., necessarily reduces the share of the other inhabitants in the state who do not participate at first in the wealth of the mines in question. — Part 2, Ch. 6, p. 171
…

If money continues to be extracted from the mines, the abundance of money will increase all prices to such a point that not only will the property owners raise their rents considerably when the leases expire and resume their old lifestyle, increasing their servants’ wages proportionally, but the artisans and workmen will increase the prices of the articles they produce so high that there will be a considerable gains in buying them from foreigners who make them much cheaper. This will naturally encourage several people to import products at lower prices from foreign factories, and this will gradually ruin the artisans and manufacturers of the state who will be unable to sustain themselves by working at such low rates because of the high cost of living. — Part 2, Ch. 6, p. 172

…

When the overabundance of money from the mines has diminished the number of inhabitants in a state, accustomed those who remain to excessive expenditures, raised the prices of farm products and the wages for labor to high levels, and ruined the manufactures of the state by the purchase of foreign products by property owners and mine workers, the money produced by the mines will necessarily go abroad to pay for the imports. This will gradually impoverish the state and make it, in a way, dependent on foreigners to whom it is obliged to send money every year as it is extracted from the mines. The great circulation of money, which was widespread in the beginning, ceases; poverty and misery follow and the exploitation of the mines appears to be only advantageous to those employed in them and to the foreigners who profit thereby. — Part 2, Ch. 6, p. 172-173

```
If this situation sounds all to familar its because it's exactly what's been going on which the US Dollar over the past half a century.


## The United States’s Gold Mine — The US Dollar

Because the US Dollar is the global reserve currency, the U.S. Government, through the Federal Reserve Bank and the Treasury, effectively have a gold mine. As long as the Fed and the Treasury act somewhat prudently, the U.S. can continue to “extract” dollars from this “gold mine” by printing new dollars or otherwise manipulating the money supply.

What happens to these dollars that get extracted? It is a process similar to that which Cantillon described above in his example of a colony that discovers a gold mine. Let me illustrate below:

First, the U.S. through central bankers, who are ultimately mine owners, print money or manipulate interest rates in a way that increases the money supply or the velocity of money. The way this is usually done is through coordinated effort with their “employees” the bankers. The bankers are the first ones to get the newly printed money, and are thus like the employees in the mines in Cantillon’s example.
