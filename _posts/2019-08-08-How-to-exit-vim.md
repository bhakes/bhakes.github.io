### Vim, the butt of every programmer joke

I found myself needing to exit Vim today and not actually remembering how. :embrassed_emoji: Exiting Vim has become the canonical programmer punchline for comparing something to a difficult task. For instance:
- "I thought I knew how to program, and then I tried to exit Vim."
- "It's going to be hard, but, hey, I know how to exit Vim, so, how hard can it be?"

### The Steps

1. Have entered a file with vim using `vim <filename>`
2. Press `ESC`
3. Type `:q`
4. Now you are out of vim. Congratulations!
